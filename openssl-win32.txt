Easy-RSA requires the openssl program in order to perform cryptographic
operations. Under Windows, this program is not a standard package as it is on
Unix-alike systems.

The easiest solution is to update the system PATH environmental variable to
reference a functioning OpenSSL installation.

Optionally, a full path to the openssl program can be defined for Easy-RSA at
runtime by one of two methods: either put the path in the OPENSSL environment
variable, or define it in a 'vars' file (see the vars.example comments for how
to use this file.) In both cases, with the bundled interpreter Easy-RSA provides
for Windows, the path should be a qualified path in typical Windows syntax,
including extension, such as: "C:\Program Files\OpenSSL\bin\openssl.exe" -- note
that either forward or backslashes are accepted.

How to obtain OpenSSL:

If using OpenVPN, the program installer offers to install the openssl program
and add it to the system default path (although as of this writing both these
options are not defaults when installing OpenVPN.)

Another option is to install a pre-compiled binary release of OpenSSL from the
openssl.org website, which links to a binary release. The dir holding the binary
will then need to be set up in the system PATH or passed to Easy-RSA as
described above.

Why Easy-RSA doesn't ship with its own OpenSSL binary:

In the event a security-sensitive release of OpenSSL is published, it should not
be necessary to update Easy-RSA itself; Easy-RSA merely uses openssl, and thus
will not ship with a bundled copy.
